# Hello guys and gals!

I am trying to learn bootstrap and I found this tutorial on https://medium.freecodecamp.org/learn-bootstrap-4-in-30-minute-by-building-a-landing-page-website-guide-for-beginners-f64e03833f33 .

Hopefully, this will refresh my html, css, and javascript too :) I feel that those skills are starting to become rusty.
